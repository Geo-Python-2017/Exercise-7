# Exercise 7: Plotting climate data in Python

This week we'll put together our data analysis and plotting skills using Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize the temperature data we have been exploring for the course thus far.
For each problem you will create or modify a Python script, then upload your files to GitHub.
The answers to the questions in this week's exercise should be given by modifying the document in places where asked or at the end of this document in the [section titled Answers](#answers).

- **Exercise 4 is due by 16:00 on 27.10.**

## Problem 0 - Creating the data file for this week

Your first task in this exercise is to write out a file with the contents of the Pandas DataFrame(s) you produced in [Exercise 6](https://github.com/Geo-Python-2017/Exercise-6), Problems 3 and 4.
As described in [Lesson 5](https://geo-python.github.io/2017/lessons/L5/pandas-basic-operations.html#writing-data), data can be saved to a file in Pandas using `dataFrame.to_csv('file.csv, sep=',')`.
Start by creating one data file for the Helsinki temperature data (`helsinki.csv`) and a second for the Sodankyl√§ data (`sodankyla.csv`).

## Problem 1 - Doing time, plotting temperatures (5 points)

In this problem the goals are to:

1. Load the Helsinki temperature data file produced above (`helsinki.csv`) into Pandas
2. Convert the `DATE_m` column to the Pandas datetime format.
3. Set the `DATE_m` column as the DataFrame index
4. Make a line plot of temperatures in Celsius from 2010-2017.

  - The line should be a dashed black line with circles for the data points, and include a descriptive title and axis labels.
